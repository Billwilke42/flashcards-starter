# Bills FlashCards
This application was made using ES6 classes to play a game in the command line. This was done by making test files for each of the classes made for the app.

## Setup

1.) Clone down the repo in the command line. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal. Once the tests have run and passed, hit ctrl + c to get out of the tests.

Running `node index.js` from the root of the project should result in the game beginning.
